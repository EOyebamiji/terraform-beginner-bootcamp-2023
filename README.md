## Semantic Versioning

This project will utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.

Semantic Versioning, often abbreviated as [SemVer](https://semver.org/), is a versioning scheme for software that aims to communicate meaningful information about the underlying changes in a software package or library. It provides a standardized way to indicate the nature of changes between different versions of a software product, making it easier for developers and users to understand how updates may affect their systems and whether they need to take action.

The General version format is **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** e.g., `1.0.1` increment the:
 
- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes


Additionally, Semantic Versioning allows for pre-release and build metadata to be added, using hyphens and plus signs, respectively, as follows:

- **Pre-release version:** A hyphen followed by an identifier (e.g., "1.0.0-alpha.1"). Pre-release versions indicate that the software is in development and not yet considered stable.

- **Build metadata:** A plus sign followed by additional information (e.g., "1.0.0+20130313144700"). Build metadata is typically used for build-related information and doesn't affect the version's precedence.

Semantic Versioning helps developers and users understand the impact of updates quickly. For example, if you see a change from version ``1.2.3`` to ``1.3.0``, you know that new features have been added but the existing functionality should remain compatible. If it changes to ``2.0.0``, you should be cautious, as there might be breaking changes.
